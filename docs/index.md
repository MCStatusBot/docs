To get started with the Minecraft Status Discord Bot, you will need to have the `manage server` permission in your Discord server. Once you have the necessary permission, follow these steps:

**Invite the bot:** You can invite the bot to your Discord server by visiting mcstatusbot.site/invite

**Add your Minecraft server:** Use the `/minecraft-server add` command to add your first Minecraft server to the bot. Fill out all the required fields and take note of the ID the bot returns, as you may need it in the future to add your Minecraft server to your Discord server.

**Link your Minecraft server:** Link your Minecraft server to your Discord server with the `/discord-server link-mcserver` command, giving the ID of your Minecraft server.

**Enable message status:** Use the `/discord-server add-message-watcher` command to enable message server status, giving the ID of your Minecraft server.

**Enable channel status:** Use the `/discord-server add-channel-watcher` command to enable channel status. Give the ID of your Minecraft server, and the bot will automatically create a category and one or two voice channels depending on which option you selected.

And that's it! You're now ready to use the Minecraft Status Discord Bot to keep track of your Minecraft server's status right from your Discord server
