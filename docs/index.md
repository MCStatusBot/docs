A Discord bot that will display, log and graph the status and statistics of a Minecraft server

this bot is completely free to use you do not need to pay to unlock anything or gain access to this code if you did pay for this code or to unlock something please [contact me](#contact)

## Quick Start
you will need the `manage server` permission to invite the bot and run these commands in the server.

- [invite the bot](https://mcstatusbot.site/invite) to your server

- add your first Minecraft server to the bot by entering the command `/add-mc-server` then fill out all required fields, take note of the id the bot returns (you might need this in the future eg adding your mc server to another discord server)

- enable message server status by entering the command `/enable-message-status` then fill out all required fields.

- enable channel status by entering the command `/enable-channel-status` then fill out all required fields, the bot will then automatically create a category and one or two voice channels depending on which option you selected.
