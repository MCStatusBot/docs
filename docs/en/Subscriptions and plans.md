# Subscriptions and Plans

In this bot, a plan refers to predefined features that you receive for a monthly price. A subscription represents the active plan you are currently paying for.


## Signing Up/Getting a Subscription

You can sign up for a subscription through our webstore at https://mcstatusbot.site/store/. During the process, you may need to authorize us to access your details, including your email. I require this information for payment invoicing and to send you emails regarding your subscription, such as payment reminders or cancellations.

In our store, you will find a list of available plans. store home img (Add image of the store home page)

To choose a plan, simply click on the desired option. This will redirect you to stripe.com, a secure payment handling site. Stripe handles all payments securely so that I don't need to. The process is straightforward: sign up for the subscription, and once the first payment is made, your subscription will be activated, granting you all the benefits of your plan. stripe checkout img (Add image of the Stripe checkout page)


## What Happens When I Miss a Payment?

To ensure uninterrupted service, it is essential to make timely payments. Stripe, our payment system, will send you email notifications regarding payment due dates. If you happen to miss a payment, the following consequences will occur:

If you have created more than 5 Minecraft servers (the limit for the free plan), all Minecraft servers will be suspended. This means you will be unable to edit your server details or page, and the auto-pinger will not check the status of your servers.

If you exceed the number of Minecraft server logs allowed by the free plan, those logs will remain but become inaccessible.

Extra linked Minecraft servers and additional channel/message watchers will cease to function.

To resolve these issues, you need to make a payment. Once the payment is successful, your subscription will reactivate. If you wish to discontinue payments, please refer to the "Canceling Your Subscription" section below.


## Canceling Your Subscription

To cancel your subscription, you have two options:

Go to your user settings on the dashboard and click on "Cancel Subscription."
Directly visit https://mcstatusbot.site/store/cancel and click the prominent red "Cancel" button.
After initiating the cancellation process, you will need to perform the following steps:

 - Select and delete any additional Minecraft servers you have created.
 - Review each Discord server added to the plan and remove any extra linked Minecraft servers then Deselect any extra channel/message watchers.

Once you have completed these steps for each server and clicked "Remove Server from Plan" then you can proceed to cancel your plan.

## Refunds

Refunds are not provided. It is your responsibility to cancel your plan in due time. By using the service, it is assumed that you understand the features and that the service meets your expectations.
