# Minecraft Server Administration

An admin is a user who has permission to manage your Minecraft server. For example, if you give your friend op status on your Minecraft server, you would also add them as an admin. You can add up to 25 admins to your Minecraft server.

To add an admin, use the /minecraft-server add-admin command. Enter the IP or ID of the server after mcserver-id, and mention the user you want to add as an admin after user. Here's an example:


## How to View and Edit All Admins

To view all admins on your server, use the /minecraft-server view command with the server's IP or ID. Then, click the "View Admins" button. Your message will change to show a dropdown menu that lets you select different admins. To toggle their permissions on or off, simply click the button.

## What Do the Permissions Mean/Do?
