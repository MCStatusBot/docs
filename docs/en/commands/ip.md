# /ip

The /ip command is a simple command that retrieves the IP of the Minecraft server. By default, it retrieves the IP of the Discord server's default Minecraft server. However, you can use the select menu to choose between one of the added Minecraft servers.

To use the command, simply type /ip in the chat, and the bot will respond with the IP address of the default Minecraft server. If you want to retrieve the IP address of a specific server, use the select menu to choose the server, and then type /ip in the chat again. The bot will respond with the IP address of the selected server.
