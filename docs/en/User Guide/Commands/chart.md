# /Chart
One of our most popular commands, /Chart, allows you to create highly customizable charts and embeds in your Discord server. You have a choice between three different types of charts: uptime, players online, and most active.

At the bottom of the embed, you will see the name of the currently selected Minecraft server. If you click on it, a dropdown menu will appear with all the Minecraft servers that have been added to your Discord server. Clicking on any of them will select that Minecraft server and show you the embed for that specific server.

This feature allows you to easily switch between different Minecraft servers and view their respective embeds without having to use separate commands or go through a complicated setup process. We hope it makes managing multiple Minecraft servers in your Discord community a breeze.

## /Chart uptime

This chart displays your server's uptime over the course of three months. You can customize what the embed says by following the instructions in our guide on customizing your chart embeds.

<br>


## /Chart players online

This chart displays the number of players online each time your server is "pinged" over the course of three months. This can be a useful tool for monitoring your server's activity and identifying trends over time.

<br>


## /Chart most active

This chart shows your most active players - these are the players who are seen the most throughout the time your server gets pinged. This can be a great way to recognize and reward your most engaged community members.
