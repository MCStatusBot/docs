It allows you to create customizable charts and embeds that display your Minecraft server's statistics directly in your Discord server. With /Chart, you can choose between three different types of charts: uptime, players online, and most active. To switch between different Minecraft servers, simply click on the server name at the bottom of the embed. A dropdown menu will appear, showing you all the Minecraft servers that have been added to your Discord server. Clicking on any of them will select that server and show you the corresponding embed. Using /Chart makes managing multiple Minecraft servers in your Discord community a breeze, as you can easily switch between different server stats without using separate commands or going through a complicated setup process. /chart mostactive \u00b6 Use this command to display the most active players on your server. These are the players who are seen the most throughout the time your server gets pinged. Recognizing and rewarding your most engaged community members can help keep your server active and thriving. /chart playersonline \u00b6 This command displays the number of players online each time your server is \"pinged\" over the course of three months. This can be a useful tool for monitoring your server's activity and identifying trends over time. /chart uptime \u00b6 This command displays your server's uptime over the course of three months. You can customize what the embed says by following the instructions in our guide on customizing your chart embeds. To customize what these embeds say, please refer to our guide on customizing your chart embeds. We hope you find /Chart to be a useful and valuable tool for your Discord server.
